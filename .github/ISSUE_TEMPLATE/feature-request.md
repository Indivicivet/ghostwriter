**FeatureRequest**

the original ghostwriter writer(amem), wereturtle, says:

>At this present time, I do not have the bandwidth to work on new feature requests. As such, new feature requests filed in GitHub will be closed. This does not mean ghostwriter will cease to have new features. On the contrary! ghostwriter has quite the backlog of feature requests already filed in GitHub.

however, on this spin-off repo I do not care. however, please note if you make a feature request, I probably won't do anything about it, unless it seems both of interest to me and easy. however feel free to use this fork to dump your ideas as issues just so they don't get forgotten -- that's what I'll be using them for.

if you wish to report a bug, doing that on the original wereturtle/ghostwriter repo is more likely to result in a fix, I imagine, but again I'm not responsible for that :)
